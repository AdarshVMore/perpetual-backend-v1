# => want to Long / Short an Asset ? 
# => place a limit / market order 
[ here we are manually defining Qty , Price and leverage at the same point and Margin , Collateral , NotionValue, Maintainance Margin , Mark price , etc is been calculated ]
# => if Market order, 
it gets filled with best price for the qty and THEN your longing / shorting starts 
# => if it is Limit Order and you longed and your order isnt matched 
you will sit on order book and if someone wants to Short with same price your order will fill / partially filles and only the your longing will start 
# => now after longing / shorting is placed 
now PnL engine takes live prices from Binance or anyhere and calculates unRealised PnL and uses some formula there 
    (CurrentPrice - EntryPrice) x Qty = PnL
# => now you can manually close the longing and sit again on order book at final price you decide and get matched with someone who is shorting and get filled 
# => if not you will go on until your loss > collateral 
there it will autoLiquidate after a maintainance margin like 5% 
# => Now again matching engine will start matching and order will be filled then


## Things i Need to make
- Matching Logic
- Position Logic => track live PnL with live Position of Long / Short.
- Lock Collateral Logic
- Risk Logic checking Liquidation
- calculate Mark Price with index price
- Liquidation Engine to Force close bad positions
- Funding Rate Engine - Keep perp price near spot

## Updated Flow:
1. User input => price, Qty, Leverage, Long/Short, Open/Close, Market/limit 
<!-- price x qty has to be equal to leverage x margin . i.e. margin = (price x quantity) / leverage
    no Margin as input from user because it can create Inconssitent Values. calculate Marign
 -->
2. quantity validation && market exists && limit price validation => qty > 0 && __ && price > 0
3. Validate Margin => check if Available balance > Margin => Collateral = Margin user inputed
4. Calculate notional => Margin x Leverage 
<!-- IF allowing Marin as input can do thi as a check Notional === price x qty , then it is a valid order -->
4. required margin => requiredMargin = (price x Qty) / Leverage . has to be -> requiredMargin <= AvailableBalance
6. Lock collateral => Available Balance - requiredMargin
7. Create pending order => status as Pending => add in User's Orders 
<!-- position can be added only when the order is filled and position is created, cause it might fill the order partially so entry price for position might change -->
8. Matching engine => travers through Bids/Asks Array and check for Best price for Market => add price-time priority
9. Partial/full fill handling => if partial fill , it would be a case of slipage mentioned on point 21
10. Add fills => add each fill in Fills array 
11. Create/update position => check existing position and update in it if not there, create new one 
    No position         -> Create
    Same side           -> Increase
    Opposite smaller    -> Reduce
    Opposite equal      -> Close both
    Opposite larger     -> Reverse
12. Calculate average entry => if position is updated for Same Side
13. Calculate liquidation price => [a live price of SOL where that Order has to autoLiquidate, can bare more loss than this because Collateral isnt enough]
long: EntryPrice x (1 - (1/leverage) + maintainanceMargin %)
short: EntryPrice x (1 + (1/leverage) - maintainanceMargin %)
Maintainance Margin = 5% means = 5% of initial Margin
14. Update unrealized pnl => (CurrentPrice - EntryPrice) x qty
15. Risk engine check => check if Margin + PnL >= MaintainanceMargin. else autoLiquidation
16. Maintenance margin check 
17. Auto liquidation if needed => loop through open orders with every price update in Binance API
18. Liquidation order enters orderbook 
19. Matching engine executes liquidation
20. Final state

21. Case of Slipage => 1 Price Level wont fill your Position Opening => partial fills different different prices
    before => 90 → 10   new Order => 25 qty at MarketPrice          90 → removed
              91 → 8                                                91 → removed
              92 → 20                                               92 → 13 remaining
    3 different fills in Fills[]
    But in Position[] entryPrice = weightedAvg = [(10×90)+(8×91)+(7×92)​] / 25 = 90.88 as EntryPrice for this position
    Because of Slipage User might get -ve PnL in start, becs bought at higher prices as well


<!-- =======================   CANCLE ORDER FLOW   ========================== -->
1. If Order is not filled completely and is on orderbook
2. user click on Close order for this :OrderId
3. unLock the Collateral 
4. change status of the :Order
4. remove from OrderBook

## Important Points Cleared
- Longing Position => goes to BIDS
- shorting Position => goes to ASKS
- Closing Long => goes to Asks [becomes Sell basically] 
- Closing Short => goes to Bids [becomes Buy basically]
- User cannot do 10 different Long orders
    it new long gets added to users existing Long
    calculating the average price => as index price 
- If User has Longed and creates new Short
    it will reduce the qty from Long
    eg: old => Long 10 @100
        new => Short 5 @110
        Final => keep only: Long 5 @100


Questions:
- What is lastTradedProce
- What is indexPrice and, actualy price to map an Order. difference betn both
- if action is Open Order / Close Order for Close as well can i specify as Limit/Market Close ? or will it close at the current MarketPrice + realised PnL for the amount of quantity user getting  (current MarketPrice + realised PnL) x qty in his available balance?
 => True



# Edge Cases i am not covering
- for Market Order => if there are not enough qty to fill in all orders combined it should [cancle the order / partial fill and cancle the remaining order / other]
- Position is Opened with every Partial Fill of an order as well


# working on right now
- unrealised PNL                                    DONE
- relaised PNL                                      DONE
- autoLiquidationCheck on every price change        DONE
- the Live PnL has to be calculated via Websocket from Binance


- Frontend ke lie Sare projects deployed and working + [AI-Code-Reviewer, Perps frontend + backend]

# tonight
- Try Binance & Backpack perp dashboard and check what are we entering , how are they working under the hook how are the calculating all of it
- websocket under the hood back and forth from ChatGPT
- Redis Queues under the hood back and forth from ChatGPT
- Pub/Sub under the hood back and forth from ChatGPT
- Perps Entire System of Binance => ask questions and understand the reason for each and everything why they do what they do

# Current Status

-----

- Open => Market => Long        
    1. Add Order in Users.Order[]   
    2. Looping through OrderBook.sortedAskPrices => got "bestPrice"
    3. Get LinkedList of Orders with "bestPrice"
    4. Looping through Orders[] in LinkedList
    5. get Qty of Order and fullFill it => reduce from LinkedList Order && Users.Order.Qty => Updating Status => Add in Fills[]
    6. for Every Fill => add in Users Positions => Following this:
        No position         -> Create
        Same side           -> Increase
        Opposite smaller    -> Reduce
        Opposite equal      -> Close both
        Opposite larger     -> Reverse
    <!-- need to update the remaining values in userPosition -->

- Open => Market => Short       1. Add Order in Users.Order[]
- Open => Limit => Long         1. Add Order in Users.Order[]
- Open => Limit => Short        1. Add Order in Users.Order[]

- Close => Market => Long       
- Close => Market => Short      
- Close => Limit => Long
